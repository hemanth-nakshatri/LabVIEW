# LabVIEW
A few LabVIEW programs

## Transfer Function
A graphical program to generate transfer function of a mechanical system when its physical constants are given.

## Root Locus
A LabVIEW program to plot Root Locus for a given transfer function. This gives the a description of the stability of the system.

## Routh-Herwitz Criterion
A program that generates a Routh array and returns the number of sign changes in the array. This gives us the relative stability of the system.
